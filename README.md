# Median, Gaussian and Average Blurring 
blur an image with different methods

In this Python code an image file should be chosen as an input file. The image then will be blurred with 
Average Blur, Median Blur and Gaussian Blur techniques and shown in a plot.  

The default value for amount of blurriness is 5, then we can modify the value by changing the scrollbar under the plot.
